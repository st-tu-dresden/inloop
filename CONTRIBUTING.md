## How to contribute to INLOOP

### Report bugs or suggest new features

INLOOP is made by humans and humans make mistakes. We encourage anyone to open issues in
our [issue tracker][inloop-issues]. Bug reports should clearly describe the problem and
include a step by step description on how to reliably reproduce the problem.


### Submit pull requests

This is the **preferred way of contributing**. We also use this approach (aka the
[Github flow][gh-flow]) internally to peer review changes.

1. Fork our repo and create a branch for the feature or bugfix. The branch name should be
   descriptive and in _kebab case_, i.e., all lowercase with `-` separating words. It should
   begin with the GitHub issue number (if any). For example: `refactor-html`,
   `add-registration-tests` or `123-refactor-js-code`.
2. Add commits and be sure to follow our [rules for commit messages](#commit-messages).
   Don't mix unrelated changes into one commit.
3. Open a pull request so we can review the changes and give feedback. Additionally,
   our Travis CI will check if the test suite succeeds.

New code needs to include [unit tests][django-testing], documentation and must follow our [coding
conventions](#coding-conventions).


### Git setup

If not done already, configure your real name and email:

    git config --global user.name "John Doe"
    git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com

Apply the following configuration to your local Git clone of INLOOP:

    git config merge.ff false
    git config pull.rebase true


## Python dependency management

We use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage Python dependencies.
The tool reads and saves requirements from and to [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml)
and [poetry.lock](poetry.lock) files. The latter one contains _exact_ versions
and hashes of _all_ dependencies (transitive deps included), ensuring
reproducible installations.

### Most important poetry commands

* Add a dependency: `poetry add some-package`.
  * Use `poetry add --dev some-package` if your package is only needed during development.
* Add a dependency with a version constraint: `poetry add some-package@^1.2.3`.
  * This can also be used to update the version constraint of an
    existing dependency, e.g., when moving from Django 1.11 to 2.0.
  * Check the [poetry manual](https://python-poetry.org/docs/dependency-specification/)
    for details about possible constraints.
  * Beware, `zsh` users: you should escape the caret (`^`) symbol used in caret constraints.
* Update a dependency: `poetry update some-package`.
  * In other words, this updates the pinned version in `poetry.lock`.
  * Keep in mind that the version constraints in `pyproject.toml` still apply.
* Update poetry itself: `poetry self update`.
  * This will only work if poetry was installed with the recommended installation method
    and _not_ with `pip` or `pipx`.
  * In our CI setup, poetry is installed with `pip` and the version is pinned in
    [tools/ci-requirements.txt](tools/ci-requirements.txt).

### Dependency update process

General rules:
* Update dependencies individually.
* Perform work on an isolated branch, e.g., `update-dependencies`.
* Create separate commits for individual version changes in `poetry.lock`.

Steps:
1. Update the given dependency, let's say Django: `poetry update django`.
2. Ensure tests succeed locally: `make test`.
3. Review the changes to `poetry.lock` with `git diff` and note the
   version before and after the change.
4. Commit changes with a commit message of the form:
   `Bump django from 1.11.28 to 1.11.29`, i.e., "Bump X from Y to Z".
5. Push the branch, create a PR and wait for Travis to finish its checks.

### Upgrading Django major or minor versions

In our `pyproject.toml`, the Django version is specified with a "tilde constraint"
to avoid automatic switches to the next minor or major version, e.g., from 1.11.x
to 1.12.y or from 1.11.x to 2.0.y.

Thus, `poetry update django` will at most update the patch version, e.g., from
1.11.28 to 1.11.29.

The reason for this is that major or minor Django version upgrades should only
be done manually with careful review of the release notes and thorough testing.

For a major or minor upgrade, you need to run `poetry add` again with an updated
version constraint. For example, to upgrade from the current Django 1.11 to the
latest version, run `poetry add django@latest`. This will update `pyproject.toml`
in addition to `poetry.lock`, and thus both need to be included in your
"Bump django …" commit (see [previous section](#dependency-update-process)).


## Rules for contributing code

### Size your PRs

Do one thing at a time and don't bite off more than you can chew. Long living branches are
usually a sign that a feature needs to be split up. Furthermore, chances are high that such a
branch will be hard to integrate into `main`. Divide and conquer!


### Coding conventions

* Use an editor that understands our [.editorconfig](.editorconfig) file. This ensures all
  contributions conform to the same indentation style, maximum line length, encoding etc.
* All languages – write code that's easy to read:
  * Keep functions/methods small (ideally half a screen page). Split if necessary.
  * Separate data from code as much as possible.
  * Document _what_ your code does in doc comments (not _how_ it does something).
* Python:
  * Use Python 3.
  * Code must be (auto-)formatted according to the [black code style][black-style] (which in turn
    formats code to conform to [PEP-8][pep8]) and a maximum line length of 99 characters.
    * This will be enforced by the CI build.
    * Be sure to configure your editor to do this for you. Modern editors such as VS Code can be
      configured to automatically invoke the `black` code formatter when a file is saved.
  * Don't use relative imports.
  * Docstrings must follow the [Google Python Style Guide for Comments][google-style] and be
    surrounded by three double quotes (`"""`). Don't use reStructured Text style comments.
* HTML (Django templates):
  * Don't use XML style empty tags (good: `<br>`, bad: `<br />`).
  * Use the [W3C Nu validator][nu-validator] to verify that the output of processed templates is
    valid HTML5.
* JavaScript:
  * New code should use modern JavaScript, a.k.a. _ECMAScript 2015_ or _ES6_.
    * Start JS files with `"use strict";`.
    * Write classes with the `class` syntax.
    * Prefer `let` over `var`, use `const` whenever possible.
    * Use arrow function expressions where appropriate.
  * Use the new APIs: Promise API, Fetch API, etc.
  * Avoid deep nesting.
  * Avoid polluting the global namespace (`window`).
  * Avoid inline scripts (i.e., inside `<script>` tags).
  * Don't use jQuery if there's an easy JS-native way to do it.
  * Docstrings must follow the [JSDoc documentation specifications][jsdoc].


### Commit messages

Rules (courtesy of [Chris Beams][good-commits1]):

1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
3. Capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
7. Use the body to explain _what_ and _why_ (not _how_)

Model message (based on [Tim Pope's][good-commits2]):

    Capitalized, short (50 chars or less) summary

    More detailed explanatory text, if necessary.  Wrap it to about 72
    characters or so.  In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
    subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body.  The blank
    line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit
    the body entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run the
    two together.
