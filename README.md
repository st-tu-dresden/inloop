INLOOP, the interactive learning center for object-oriented programming, is a lean web app for
online programming courses, built upon Django and Docker:

- **Flexible**: you can write tasks for arbitrary languages, as long as they can be packaged into a
  Docker image.
- **Secure**: solutions are checked inside a minimal and strictly isolated Docker container, which
  is discarded after execution.
- **Modern**: push-based (or periodic pull-based) import of tasks, Markdown task descriptions and
  accompanying attachments from a Git repository.
- **Fast & scalable**: solutions are processed asynchronously by a configurable amount of
  background workers.
- **Hackable**: modern, modular and PEP-8 compliant Python 3 code base with less than 3000 lines of
  code, good test coverage and continuous integration tests.

TEST.

## Quick start

INLOOP requires the following software:

* Debian 8+ or Ubuntu 16.04+, macOS 10.11+ (for development only)
* Python 3.4 or 3.5
* Docker 1.10+ (see the [installation notes](docs/installation_notes.md) **!!!**)
* Redis 2.6+
* Git 2.3+

Using the command line, a development instance can be set up as follows:

```bash
# 1.) install required software for Debian/Ubuntu or macOS
./support/scripts/[debian|macos]_setup.sh

# 2.) initialize a virtualenv with all required Python packages
make devenv && source .venvs/py3*/bin/activate

# 3.) start and monitor the web server and huey workers
honcho start
```

For demonstration and development purposes only, a superuser account *admin* and an ordinary user
account *student* have been created, with both passwords set to *secret*.

**Tip**: Add the line `DJDT=1` to your `.env` file to enable the Django debug toolbar.
