    <h2>We happy?</h2>
    <p>The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men.
        Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for
        he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great
        vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name
        is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee. </p>

    <h2>I took lessons</h2>
    <p>Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how
        you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And most times they're
        friends, like you and me! I should've known way back when... You know why, David? Because of the kids. They
        called me Mr Glass. </p>

    <h2>Is she dead, yes or no?</h2>
    <p>You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world
        once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly
        when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now
        we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it
        wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man. </p>

    <h2>I took lessons</h2>
    <p>Like you, I used to think the world was this great place where everybody lived by the same standards I did, then
        some kid with a nail showed me I was living in his world, a world where chaos rules not order, a world where
        righteousness is not rewarded. That's Cesar's world, and if you're not willing to play by his rules, then you're
        gonna have to pay the price. </p>
